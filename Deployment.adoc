= Deploying the Website
Russel Winder

== Introduction

This website comes in two halves: the Nikola managed half for static material; and the Flask managed half
for the dynamic proposal submission and review part. Overall the whole is managed by Flask using blueprints:
the Nikola managed static material is embedded in a Flask application for deployment. Note though that the
Flask theme is mostly in the Nikola theme, but a bit of the Nikola theme is in the Flask part. Some of the
theme files have to be deployed – these are in the Flask managed area – the rest is just static material and
is in the Nikola managed ares, including all the JavaScript and CSS code used by the Flask application. As
far as is known this is all laid out correctly for deployment. It means though that for development you have
to run a script to create some symbolic links in the local clone. These are needed for testing on the CI but
not for the deployed website.

== Deployment Targets

There are two deployment targets https://testconference.accu.org (for testing, unsurprising given the name)
and https://conference.accu.org (the live website). For deployment these are accessed via SSH as:

* conference@dennis.accu.org:/srv/testconference/public/htdocs
* conference@dennis.accu.org:/srv/conference/public/htdocs

respectively. Access is by SSH key access only. The person to whom the email address conference@accu.org is
redirected is officially the person who has the public keys to access these areas.

The URLs above are controlled by the Apache2 instance, and are specified in:

* conference@dennis.accu.org:/etc/apache2/sites-available/testconference.accu.org.conf
* conference@dennis.accu.org:/etc/apache2/sites-available/conference.accu.org.conf

The certificates for the virtual sites are managed by Let's Encrypt. They should be self-renewing, but
sometimes there are problems. When these occur, the ACCU server sys. admins. are the people to solve them.

== Deployment Process

The overall process for ongoing deployment (not an initial installation) is:

* cd static_nikola_part
** nikola build
** nikola build
** nikola deploy testconference
** nikola deploy conference
* cd flask_application_part
** py.test-3
** ./scripts/deploy.sh testconference
** ./scripts/deploy.sh conference

However an actual deployment is never quite like just running these commands in a clone.

Running the Nikola build twice is only actually needed in the situation where there has been a change to the
accuconf CSS files – there is an issue in Nikola such that you have build to create the deployment CSS files
and then run the build again to create the deployable HTML files. Ostensibly the bug has been fixed, but
pragmatically that appears not to be the case.

It should be feasible to deploy to the live server https://conference.accu.org from any clone of the
mainline Git repository. The deploy scripts do not copy the locally defined configuration file of the
repository being deployed from even if it exists.  The module
flask_application_part/accuconf/configuration.py contains a number of classes that define the pre-defined
server states found to be needed. It defines the default `Config` which is effectively the static website
with no flask application and is in the repository. To create a different website state create a
flask_application_part/accuconf_config.py module that, by whatever Pythonic means, defines a symbol `Config`
– this `Config` symbol will override the default one. There is no flask_application_part/accuconf_config.py
file in the repository, so any checkout of the repository starts with the default state that can be changed
by adding a file of this name. This configuration file must remain uncommitted. This means the deployed
material has its own independent state: the state of the live server is determined by a file that only
exists on the server.

== The Installation Environments

=== The ACCU Host

Both the live server and the test server on the ACCU host use a Python 3 virtual environment. This is
located at conference@dennis.accu.org:/srv/conference.accu.org/Python3. The file
flask_application_part/pip_requirements.txt contains the set of packages installed into this virtual
environment.

This virtual environment is kept up to date on an ad hoc basis except during the submission and
review period when it is left well alone.

=== Development Environment

For preparation and deployment you need to have the packages in:

* flask_application_part/pip_requirements.txt
* flask_application_part/pip_test_requirements.txt
* static_nikola_part/requirements.txt

If your platform has package management that allows all these to be installed all well and good. Generally
though it is likely best to use a virtual environment. Instructions on setting up a development environment
(and hence a deployment environment) are in HowToStart.adoc.

=== Travis-CI Environment

As can be seen from .travis.yml, the CI environment is that of development using a virtual environment,
