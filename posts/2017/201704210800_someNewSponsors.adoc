Three new sponsors of ACCU 2017 to note.

The first is https://www.riverblade.co.uk[Riverblade], a company deeply committed to making software
developers' lives better with good development tools. In fact Riverblade signed up as a sponsor a while
back, but due to failure on the part of the wetware running this website, their logo was not added to the
list of sponsors, and blog entry not posted. This is particularly bad as Riverblade have been a staunch
supporter of ACCU conferences for many years. I hope the good folk at Riverblade accept the wetware's
apologies for this error.

The first of our actually newly signed up sponsors is http://snsystems.com/[SNSystems]. It is great to have
this games-oriented company on board. Games may be fun (mostly), but software that implements the games, and
perhaps more importantly, the software that implements the tools and frameworks programmers used to write the
games software are important bits of software. ACCU members like good software.

Our second new sponsor is https://www.steema.com/[Steema]. Anyone involved with data is aware that
visualisation of that data is a critical part of finding information from that data. Steema contribute to
visualisation by making charting software. Expect prizes from them at ACCU 2017.
