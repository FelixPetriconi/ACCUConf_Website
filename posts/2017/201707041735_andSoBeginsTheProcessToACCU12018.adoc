The observant may have noticed something of a change in the ACCU conference website. We have decided that
#363e6d (aka Dark Midnight Blue) will be the colour for ACCU 2018. The rationale for this will not be
revealed now (so as to engender a feeling of suspense) and may, or may not, be revealed sometime in the next
8 monthsfootnote:[With apologies to the late (, very late) Douglas Adams for the allusion to the style of
writing in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.].

The website has been rearranged to create a clean slate for ACCU 2018, with ACCU 2017 joining ACCU 2016 in
the "Previous ACCU" drop down menu. I expect various changes to happen to the website over the next few
months. The source is still a https://github.com/ACCUConf/ACCUConf_Website[Git repository on
GitHub]. Investigators of this repository will notice that it is now just the source of the static website
generated using https://getnikola.com[Nikola]. The Web application for submission and review is being
rewritten and is now separated completed from the main website â€“ avoiding many of the problems people had
last year. The new "submission Web application" has it's own repository
https://github.com/ACCUConf/ACCUConf_Submission_Web_Application[here]. Work has only just started on this
Python3/Flask/SQLAlchemy/SQLite-implemented system, but should
progress very rapidly. If you want to get involved, please feel free to chip in using the issues, and think
about possible pull requests.

Although the conference dates are now fixed (Workshop day 2018-04-10, Conference days 2018-04-11/P4D), the
dates of the call for proposals, etc. are just proposals. Unlikely to change, but they may.

If you know anyone who wants to sponsor the conference, get them to contact mailto:conference@accu.org[The
Conference Chair] in the first instance.
