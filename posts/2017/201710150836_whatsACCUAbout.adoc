The previous post was to let people know about the mechanics of session proposals and their submission. It
did not though set out the scope of ACCU conference content – hence this post.

ACCU the organisation (https://accu.org) is a membership organisation of software developers, software
engineers, programmers, coders, choose your preferred label for someone that creates software. The members are
interested in programming, programming languages, testing, the tools of developing software, the process of
developing software, and all related things. The tag line for the organisation is _Professionalism in
Programming_. ACCU produces two journals, CVu and Overload, published every other month.

ACCU the conference is put on by ACCU the organisation, but is open to anyone who wishes to attend, not just
members of the organisation. Obviously ACCU the organisation hopes that anyone not a member that attends
ACCU the conference joins ACCU the organisation – and there is a stand at the conference for people to do exactly
that.

So for content, ACCU the conference is looking for any material that is interesting to people who create
software. Historically, ACCU has a lot of {cpp} and C content, and is proud of that: ACCU is the foremost
annual conference for people interested in {cpp} and C, at least in and around the UK. But it is not just a
{cpp} and C conference, ACCU is about programming in whatever language people are using, with whatever tools
and processes people are using: D, Chapel, Java, Kotlin, C#, F#, Groovy, Rust, Go, Python, Ruby, Lisp, to
name just a few programming languages about which there have been sessions at ACCU conferences.

The call for session proposals opens tomorrow, if you have an idea for a session do submit it. If you want
to chat an idea over with someone before submitting, please email the conference chair conference@accu.org
