Huge thanks to Ahto Truu for sending in a pull request updating the ACCU 2017 conference schedule page with
links to the videos. Not all have been checked, and not all are there as yet. If you find an error, or a
link not yet in place, please feel free to send in a pull request, or at least an email telling us the
changes needed.

Thanks again Ahto Truu for getting the "updates after the conference stuff" moving. The pressure is now on
us to do the slide PDFs!
