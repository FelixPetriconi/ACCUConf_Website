A number of people at ACCU 2017 suggested that it would have been much better to have had the Conference
Dinner on the Thursday and the Bloomberg Party on the Friday, instead of the other way around. The ACCU
Conference Committee couldn't see any reason why not try doing this as an experiment. However, we have no
idea how many people prefer the way it is as we had no feedback that it was right the way it was. We are
currently organising with the new format, unless enough people think it is a bad idea. You know who
mailto:conference@accu.org[to email] if you have a view.
