So the ACCU 2018 call for session proposals ended 2017-11-17T23:59+00:00 exactly as anticipated. The
committee then went through all the proposals and scored them and, if appropriate, added a comment
or two. Also a number of irritants and glitches with the system were noted and added as issues to the
https://github.com/ACCUConf/ACCUConf_Submission_Web_Application[source repository]footnote:[If anyone who
used the system and had irritants or spotted glitches with it, or indeed has suggestions for improvements,
please feel free to add issues so we can make the system better for next year.].

The committee met, some physically, some via video call, a couple of people had to send their apologies for
absence, in Reading Saturday 2017-12-02 to review the situation, and make decisions. Some of the decisions
were very hard to make since we had many more excellent session proposals than we have space for in the
conference schedule.

It is now necessary to transfer the decisions made into data in the database, make all the consistency and
correctness checks, and then we can begin the process of informing people of the results, and doing the
sub-editing on scheduled proposals so the session data can be published. Despite the improvements made to
the system compared to last year, this remains a non-trivial activity. The question is whether things are
ready to send out notifications of acceptance before the Winter Solstice, Christmas, Hogmanay, New Year
holiday period. Just at the moment it is not possible to tell.
