http://www.archer-yates.co.uk/[Archer Yates Associates], who are the people who collaborate with
http://accu.org[ACCU] to put on ACCU conferences, have opened up registration for ACCU 2018. Thus are people
able to get tickets for ACCU 2018 as Winter Solstice / Christmas /
whatever-your-end-of-calendar-year-holiday-is-labelled presents for themselves and/or others.

True, the schedule is yet to be decided, but we do know Gen Ashley, Hadi Hariri, Seb Rose, and Lisa
Lippincott will be presenting keynotes. We also know there will be full day pre-conference tutorials, and
lots of great sessions. And social stuff.

Buy now, enjoy
later. http://www.cvent.com/events/accu-2018/event-summary-1ab2de4fe3b8445499601fc517bd8b76.aspx[Register here].
