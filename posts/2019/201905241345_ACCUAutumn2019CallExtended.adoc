== Extension to Call for Proposals Close Date

Due to requests from some members of WG21 who wish to add proposals but
for various reasons have been unable to, and also local Belfast groups
who did not receive notification of the Call for Proposals in good time,
I've decided to extend to close date until the 16th of June. This may
result in a 3rd track at the conference if the quality of proposals
matches those already received but I'll separately announce that after
the extension is closed and all proposals have been reviewed.

I'd like to thank all those who have already submitted proposals and
will invite you to use the additional time to make amendments or
adjustments to your proposal if needed, or even consider writing up
another one!

Jamie Allsop
