Although ACCU Autumn 2019 has not yet happened (register http://www.cvent.com/d/n6qp1t[here]),
we must look forward to ACCU 2020 (to be held 2020-03-25 to 2020-03-28, with pre-conference
workshops 2020-03-24, at
http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/brsdt-bristol-marriott-hotel-city-centre/[Bristol
Marriott Hotel City Centre]). In particular, it is time to open the ACCU 2020 Call for
Proposals (CfP).

If you are new to submitting sessions for ACCU conferences, you may want to read the ACCU 2020
section on https://conference.accu.org/. It explains the types of session that can be
submitted. It also has links to all the details about presenter deals.

Big change to the CfP this year: instead of using our own, homegrown Web application to collect
and review proposals, we are using the http://www.archer-yates.co.uk/[Archer Yates Associates]
(AYA – the people who do all the ACCU conference organising) instance of Firebird – a system
for managing conferences.

So in order to submit a proposal you will need to go to:

https://flame.firebird.systems/archer-yates/ACCU2020/MySubmissions

Unless you are already logged in, this takes you to the sign-up/login page. You will need to
sign up first so that you can then login and start submitting proposals.

We believe the sequenced multi-page user interface for submitting proposal details is easy to
use, and is easier/better than the old homegrown single page entry system.

As in past years the presenter biography entries and the proposal summary blurb are AsciiDoc
fragments – sadly at the time we open the CfP, the AsciiDoc fragment editor is not quite in place
so you have to enter AsciiDoc using a plain text editor. It is hoped that the AsciiDoc editor will be
in place next week. Not everyone chooses to use AsciiDoc, some people just enter plain text –
entering plain text using the AsciiDoc fragment editor is fine.

_NB The AsciiDoc fragments will be manipulated to appear within the source of the webpages on
https://conference.accu.org, see for example https://conference.accu.org/2019/sessions.html[ACCU
2019 Sessions]. It is best not to use any section heads in the fragments (they cause problems)
but lists, code fragments, notes, etc, are all available. See https://asciidoctor.org/[here] for
links to webpages explaining AsciiDoc._

So as of 2019-10-04 until 2019-10-25 23:59+01:00 the ACCU 2020 CfP is open. As ever there will
be no extension of the deadline, and we do not take late submissions.

If you have any questions or problems please email mailto:conference@accu.org[the Conference Chair].
