The Call for Proposals for ACCU 2020 is now closed. We seem to have a lot of very good
proposals. It is now for the Programme Committee members to review the proposals, and then
select the ones to add to the schedule – which is likely to be quite hard given the seemingly
high quality of the proposals.

Thank you to everyone who made a (or in some cases more than one) proposal(s).

More news as soon as the committee is in a position to make things public.
