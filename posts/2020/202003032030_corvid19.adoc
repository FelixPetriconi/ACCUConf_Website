_The cornovirus Corvid-19 situation is very fluid just now. Many are asking how this affects ACCU
2020. The official position as at 2020-03-03T20:30+00:00 is:_

We are obviously concerned about the impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on this year’s ACCU and
are closely monitoring what is happening.

Archer Yates, the conference event managers are in close contact with the Association of British
Professional Conference Organisers – ABPCO, who are in turn liaising with the UK Government.

Essentially, we see two different scenarios for the conference, depending on how the situation
develops:

. Conference happens as planned – ideally, we are able to run the conference as normal, while
ensuring measures are put in place to best protect attendees as instructed by the national and
local health authorities.
. Conference runs locally and online – In the event there are global travel restrictions, but
it is still possible to organize the conference locally, we will run the event as a local event
while streaming the content to those no longer able to attend. The workshops will run remotely
online. Clearly if the UK Government declares a major emergency and forbids any public events
being held altogether then the whole conference will be online only.

If the conference moves to some or all online we will refund 50% of the ticket price to all who
participate online. This will apply to both the workshops and the conference itself.

Clearly, we still want ACCU to be held, even if for this year it means altering the concept. We
will keep everyone informed of how things develop, and we will do all we can to ensure we get
through this challenge as a community.
