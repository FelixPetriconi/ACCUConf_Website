The conference programme committee is proud to announce the https://conference.accu.org/2020/schedule.html[ACCU 2020 Schedule] for the upcoming ACCU 2020
conference. We think it is a strong programme. We are happy that some speakers from years back have returned, last year
speakers proposed again and that there are new speakers as well.

We have decided to move from our home grown conference application to https://firebird.systems[Firebird's] conferencing
application. This system has successfully been used by our organizer http://www.archer-yates.co.uk/[Archer Yates Ltd.]
for other events.

So the actual schedule is currently been published on Firebird's system. Later we will mirror it to https://conference.accu.org.

This year we have all pieces in place. But as soon as something changes we will update the page.

People have already started registering for the pre-conference workshops and the conference
itself â€“ registering early is always good, especially for the pre-conference workshops.
