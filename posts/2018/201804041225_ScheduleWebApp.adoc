For ACCU 2017, Austin Bingham of http://sixty-north.com/[Sixty North] created an ACCU conference schedule
Web application implemented in http://elm-lang.org/[Elm]. After the conference he donated the code to the
ACCU Conference. Sadly, despite lots of good intentions, it has not been developed over the year. It seems
though right to have it running anyway. So the ACCU 2018 schedule Web application is at
https://testconference.accu.org/schedule_app/

If you do want to get stuck in to helping to develop the Web app the master Git repository is at
https://github.com/ACCUConf/ACCUConf_Schedule_Web_Application
