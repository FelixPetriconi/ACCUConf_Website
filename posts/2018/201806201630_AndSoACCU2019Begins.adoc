OK so ACCU 2019 isn't actually happening any time soon – it is scheduled for 2019-04-09 to 2019-04-13, but
preparation and planning takes quite a long time. So this is really "Planning and Preparation for ACCU 2019 has
Begun".

We have a nice logo. Well, obviously, it is essentially the same logo as ever but with a numeral changed and
in a different colour – continuity of brand imagery has a lot going for it. We hope you like the colour – or
if you are in the USA: color :-).

Of course, there can be no ACCU conference without good content, and good content requires lots of good
submissions so the committee can select from them to create a great schedule. We are busy, OK I am busy,
updating the submission Web application in the light of experience from last year. As there should be in any
project, there is a deadline for these changes, and that is 2018-10-05. Why is that? Because that is the
date of the opening of the Call for Proposals. This is really what this post is about, the *Call for
Proposals*.

The Call for Proposals will *open* _2018-10-05T10:00+00:00_.

The Call for Proposals will *close* _2018-10-26T19:00+00:00_.

So as to be fair to everyone who submits, these date/times are not negotiable. Neither will there be any
extensionsfootnote:[If, as there was a couple of years ago, there is a problem with the submission system
such that people cannot submit or amend proposals during the Call for Proposals, then appropriate
negotiations or extensions will happen. I think it fair to say this is the only situation in which it
would happen.]

Anyone who has an idea for an ACCU conference session should think it through, plan it, and create the
proposal ready to submit it during the Call for Proposals. Details on the sort of sessions at an ACCU
conference are given on the link:/index.html[front page of the website].

You have three months. Get planning to submit.
