There has been lots of activity in ACCU organising over the last two months, but we failed to tell people
the news. Our "There is a month to go" resolution is to report more news.

The news of the moment is that we have swapped a couple of sessions: Eoin Woods' session "Common Webapp
Vulnerabilities and What to Do About Them" has moved from Wednesday 2018-04-11T16:00+01:00 to Thursday
2018-04-12T16:00+01:00, and Florian Gilcher's session "Three years of Rust â€“ A look around" has moved a day
forward and will be where Eoin's session was, i.e. it's a straight swap of schedule slot.

As ever the current state of the schedule is at https://conference.accu.org/2018/schedule.html
