A final reminder: the call for proposals for ACCU 2019 opens next week 2018-10-05 and is open for
three weeks till 2018-10-26.

ACCU is a conference about programming. Given the history of the ACCU organisation, there is a lot of {cpp},
and some C, oriented content. However we have Rust, Go, Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Lisp, indeed any programming
language oriented content. Also tools and techniques of programming content: TDD, BDD, Git, Mercurial,
CMake, Meson, SCons, concurrency, parallelism, continuous integration, continuous delivery, creating
software-based startups, the list isn't endless but it is big and it is flexible. Any and all content to do with
programming is acceptable.

The conference content is entirely created from the submitted proposals. Except for the keynotes. This year
we have:

* Angela Sasse
* Kate Gregory
* Paul Grenyer
* Herb Sutter

as our keynote speakers.

As ever lead presenters of main conference sessions will get a "conference deal".
