The ACCU 2019 Call for Proposals is now open. It will close 2018-10-26T23:59+01:00.

For further details on ACCU the organisation go to https://accu.org and for further details on ACCU the
conference go to https://conference.accu.org

Submission of proposals is by logging in and entering data into the submission Web application at
https://cfp.conference.accu.org

ACCU has a lot of {cpp} content, but it has much more: Python, C#, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Lisp, Groovy,
JRuby get a look in as programming languages. Also the tools, techniques, and processes of programming are
things people present sessions on: ACCU is about anything and everything to do with programming. Main
conference sessions are 90 minutes long and are one of:

* 60 minute presentation with 30 minutes questions and answersfootnote:[Some people choose to structure this
   as 90 minutes of interactive presentation instead of 60 minutes presentation and 30 minutes  Q&A, and
   that is fine â€“ the point is to have interaction and dialogue. A 90 minutes one-way presentation without
   interaction is not really what we want.].
* a workshopfootnote:[A workshop is all about people doing things.].

Sometimes we have 180 minute workshops, i.e. double session ones, because 90 minute is sometimes just not
enough!

Lead presenters of main conference sessions are eligible for a "presenter deal" so as to be able to attend
the conference even if they cannot get funding for expenses via another route.

We also have "quickies" which are 20 minute sessions, 15 minute presentation and 5 minutes questions and
answers. Currently we are not able to provide any form of "presenter deal" for these sessions, but we are
looking for sponsors that might enable us to do something for these presenters.

ACCU puts on full day pre-conference workshops/tutorials, i.e. 6 hours with breaks. There is a
pre-conference workshop package" for lead presenters of these that includes an honorarium as well as
expenses. We are looking for introductory sessions as well as deep dive sessions so as to get wide appeal:
Rust for {cpp} programmers, {cpp} for people who do not already know it,as well as {cpp}17 and beyond, or
using Rust for Python extensions,are just a few of the sorts of thing that would get well received.

The ACCU Programme Committee members review all the proposals submitted and score them. They will from this
year also provide "comments to proposers" as well as "comments to the committee". "Comments to the
proposers" will be sent to the proposers as a matter of course. Having reviewed all the proposals the
committee then meets to select and schedule the selected sessions. This is not an easy task, but it gets
done despite this.
