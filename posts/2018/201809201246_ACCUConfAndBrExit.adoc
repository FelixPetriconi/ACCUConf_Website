As we approach October 2018 and the Call for Proposals for ACCU 2019, a number of people have expressed some
concerns about ACCU 2019 being after BrExit 2019-03-29. The issue being that post-BrExit the UK government's
apparent obsession with curtailing EU freedom of movement may lead to EU citizens having difficulties
entering the UK.

When UK leaves the EU on 2018-03-29, there is a two-year transition period and as such, nothing will change
immediately. Constraining EU citizen's entry into the UK after this date is highly unlikely.  If however,
travel into the UK by EU citizens is constrained, a move to the same sort of visa arrangements the UK
already has with non-EU nationals is the most likely scenario – either automatic entry with no visa needed
as per the current arrangement with Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore,
South Africa, South Korea and the USA; or as we do with other nationals.  In the unlikely event of EU
nationals travelling to the UK requiring visas, the ACCU organisers are able to send ‘Letters of Invitation’
to support visa applications through UK embassies and high commissions. We believe though this will not come
to be needed.

Here is a statement agreed with https://www.archer-yates.co.uk/[Archer Yates Associates] the organisation
that organises the ACCU conferences:

_Concerned about travel to the UK after Brexit? – ACCU firmly believes, free travel to the UK after Brexit
will continue as it currently operates, as part of the agreed two-year transition period. In the event of
visas being necessary, we will make available ‘Letters of Invitation’ to speakers and registered attendees to help
facilitate any visa requests they may have._
