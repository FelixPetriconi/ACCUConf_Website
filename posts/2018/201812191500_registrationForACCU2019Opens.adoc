Apologies to all for failing to keep the conference news updated over the last few weeks.

The call for proposals is now closed. The programme committee did lots of reviewing and deciding and
planning. We are thus at the stage of getting the draft schedule in place. This is a work in progress for
the moment. More news soon.

The important news of the moment is that the registration website is now up and running, and you can
register for ACCU 2019. Indeed we already have some people registered.

If you fancy joining the early bird registerers, nip over to http://www.cvent.com/d/dbqjfx and sign up.
