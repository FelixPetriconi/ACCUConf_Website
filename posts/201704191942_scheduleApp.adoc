In conjunction with his talk on Elm, Austin Bingham of
https://sixty-north.com/[Sixty North AS] has put together a
https://sixty-north.com/c/accu-2017/[new web-based schedule app] for ACCU 2017.
The app lets you search for topics and speakers, see the daily schedules, and
build a personal conference agenda.

Interested in Elm? You can find the project's source and get involved in its
development at https://github.com/abingham/accu-2017-elm-app/[the github repository].
