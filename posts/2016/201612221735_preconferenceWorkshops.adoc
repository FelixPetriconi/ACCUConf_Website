ACCU is a four-day conference, but it also has a day of full-day pre-conference workshops. For ACCU 2017, we
have, on Tuesday 2017-04-25, four workshops for you to choose from. In no particular order (*):

* _Brad Chamberlain_ is going to give us link:../stories/2017/fulldayworkshops.html#BradChamberlain[A
  Programmer's Introduction to Chapel]. Anyone interested in parallel code on any computer, but especially
  on multi-multicore processor clusters, will be interested in http://www.chapel-lang.org[Chapel]. It is a
  disruptive technology to replace Fortran, C, C++, etc. with a programming language that uses modern idioms
  to make programming parallel system fun.
* _Felix Petriconi_ will introduce link:../stories/2017/fulldayworkshops.html#FelixPetriconi[The Art of
  Writing Reasonable Concurrent Code]. All about dataflow based approaches (CSP and channels), this workshop
  will get people writing concurrent (and parallel) {cpp}14 code running with nicer more manageable and
  maintainable code, with little or no debugging required.
* _Nico Josuttis_ will get us link:../stories/2017/fulldayworkshops.html#NicoJosuttis[Moving to C++17]. A
  workshop for anyone wanting to use the latest features of {cpp} now, today.
* _Seb Rose_ and _Jon Jagger_ will be educating people about
  link:../stories/2017/fulldayworkshops.html#SebRose[Testable Architecture] If you are having difficulties
  getting you application into a well tested state, this is the workshop for you.
