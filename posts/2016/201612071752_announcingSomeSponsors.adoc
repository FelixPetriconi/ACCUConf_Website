Conferences like ACCU are always that much better when there are appropriate and good exhibitors and
sponsors. Exhibitors and sponsors add an extra dimension to the breaks, the corridor track, and the evening
activities, all of which which are important aspects of ACCU: interaction and "networking" are an integral
part of the conference. Not quite as important as high quality content of the sessions, but a very important
factor nonetheless.

We are currently in negotiations with a number of exhibitors and sponsors, but whilst negotiations are in
progress it is right and proper to say nothing. Three sponsors have however concluded negotiations and have
"signed on the dotted line". So we are very pleased to announce that https://www.jetbrains.com/[JetBrains],
http://undo.io/[Undo], and http://mosaic.fm/[Mosaic] are sponsors for ACCU 2017. We are very pleased to
display our sponsors logos on all our pages in recognition of the sponsorship provided.
