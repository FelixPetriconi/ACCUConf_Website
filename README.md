# ACCU Conference Website

## Introduction

This repository contains the framework for the [ACCU Conference website](http://conference.accu.org)
(http://conference.accu.org). The driver and manager of the dynamic content is a Flask application, the
static content is managed as a Nikola website. It is assumed that Python 3 is used for both Flask and
Nikola.

## The Toolchain

Git, obviously, but also [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/).

Many operating system distributions package Nikola (some only the Python 2 version though :-( If there is
not a suitable package then creating a virtualenv and installing Nikola from PyPI using pip works well â€“
Python 3 being the most senble choice of Python obviously.
