# ACCU Conference Website

This repository contains the general framework for the Nikola managed content of the ACCU Conference website
(http://conference.accu.org). The driver and manager of the dynamic content is the ACCUConfWebsite_Flask
repository, this is for the static content and the blog.

Many operating system distributions package Nikola (some only the Python 2 version though :-( If there is
not a suitable package then creating a virtualenv and installing Nikola from PyPI using pip works well â€“
Python 3 being the most senble choice of Python obviously.
