# ACCU Conference Website

## Introduction

This repository contains the source for the [ACCU Conference website](http://conference.accu.org)
(http://conference.accu.org). The content is managed as a Nikola website.

## The Toolchain

Git, obviously, but also [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/), again obviously.

Many operating system distributions package Nikola (some only the Python 2 version though :-( If there is
not a suitable package then creating a virtualenv and installing Nikola from PyPI using pip works well â€“
Python 3 being the most senble choice of Python obviously.
