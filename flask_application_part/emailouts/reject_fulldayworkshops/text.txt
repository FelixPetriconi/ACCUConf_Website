Thank you for your proposal for a full-day pre-conference workshop at
ACCU 2017. After much discussion and debate in the programme committee,
I have to inform you that your proposal:

    {}

has not been successful. We had many, many good proposals and only a limited
number of slots we could use: we have had to "reject" many fine proposals that
might, in other years, have easily got into the programme.

In all cases can you check that you have received information about all the
proposals you believe you submitted. The last thing we want is "lost"
submissions.

If you have any questions about this, please feel free to email me.
