If you check the current schedule you will spot that there is a TBC slot,
i.e. a slot that is currently vacant. The person first in line for the slot
is, unfortunately, not able to be in Bristol on Saturday. I am therefore
seeking someone willing to do a session slot swap with the TBC slot so that
the first-in-line person can take up the offer of the slot.

So if you have a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday slot and would be willing to
swap for the Saturday TBC slot let me know so that I can make the swap.

In the case of multiple people volunteering, it will be first email received
by me that wins.

Thanks.
