Thank you for submitting your "quickie" proposal to ACCU 2017:

    {}

we would like to accept and schedule this session as part of the programme.

If you have an accepted 90 or 180 minutes session then you will be eligible
for a "presenter deal". It is important to note that we cannot offer
"presenter deal" to people only presenting a "quickie": people only
presenting a "quickie" are conference attenders who are not reliant on
having a "presenter deal".

Please can I get you to acknowledge whether you will be attending ACCU 2017
and willing and able to present this "quickie".
