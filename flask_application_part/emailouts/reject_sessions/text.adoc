Thank you for your proposal for a session at ACCU 2017. After much discussion
and debate in the programme committee, I have to inform you that your
proposal:

    {}

has not been successful. We had many, many good proposals and only a limited
number of slots we could use: we have had to "reject" many fine proposals that
might, in other years, have easily got into the programme.

Some people submitted more than one proposal. The committee has actively
selected only one full session  conference proposal from each person, so as
to give as many people as possible opportunity to put on their session. Some
people receiving this email may already have received an email about success.

In all cases can you check that you have now received information about all
the proposals you believe you submitted. The last thing we want is "lost"
submissions.

In the event of a presenter pulling out at the last minute, we will contact
proposers of "rejected" proposals (we have a "reserve" list) to see if they
would be willing and able to switch from "reject" to "accept".

If you have any questions about this, please feel free to email me.
