Many of you have already registered for ACCU 2017, and got your
accommodation and travel arranged.  This is good. A couple of people have
pointed out though that there were no specific instructions as to what to do
next in the email that came to people accepting their sessions.

Presenters need to register on the ACCU 2017 registration website. If you
have not already done so, please head over to:

https://www.cvent.com/events/accu-2017/registration-3de49a8356234224897b9dae119466da.aspx

and complete the registration process.

It is assumed that people will be making their own travel arrangements. Also
some people choose to stay in accommodation other than the conference
hotel. Please note that the registration website only deals with the
conference hotel bookings.
