Hi,

Thank you for registering on the ACCU session proposal submission
website. Currently your bio is empty. This is most likely because you
registered before this field was on the registration page. Sorry about this
phasing error. We need to ask you to go back to the registration page and
complete the bio field. If your proposal is accepted for the conference, this
is the information about you that will be made available on the ACCU 2017
website.
