Thank you for submitting your session proposal to ACCU 2017:

    {}

we would like to accept this proposal and schedule it in the programme.

The presenter, in the case of an individual presenter, or the nominated lead
presenter in the case of multi-presenter session is eligible for a
"presenter deal".

The deal given the presenter is: free admittance to the conference; two
nights accommodation at the conference venue hotel; and refund of travel
expenses.  There is a cap on travel expenses but few people reach it.

Many presenters are funded by their employer or some other source and do not
claim the travel allowance. This helps those who have no other source of
funds to get to the conference and thus rely on the travel refund. If you
are likely to be claiming travel expenses please book well in advance (like
now :-) so as to keep the costs at a minimum.

Please can I get you to respond by return whether you will be registering
for the conference and thus willing and able to present the session. If you
are, we can then add it to the schedule.
