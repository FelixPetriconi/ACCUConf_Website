Thank you for your proposal for a one-day workshop at ACCU 2017:

    {}

We would like to accept this proposal as part of ACCU 2017, and hope you
are still able to run the workshop on Tuesday 2017-04-25.

Please can you email me as soon as possible to confirm you will be able to
run the workshop so I can get the organisers (Archer Yates) to contact you
to finalise the agreement.

As soon as your acceptance is formalised, we can publicise your workshop on
the ACCU 2017 website and start taking bookings for people to attend the
session.
