Below is the blurb we have for your ACCU 2017 session:

    {}

This text will be used as part of the generation of webpages for the
conference.

This text is treated as an Asciidoc fragment when the webpages for the
conference website are generated. Thus it is possible to have markup.

Can I get you to reply either accepting the blurb as is or sending the
amendments you want.
