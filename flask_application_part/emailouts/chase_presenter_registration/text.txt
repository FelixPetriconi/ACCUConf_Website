Hello {},

According to the records you haven't yet registered for ACCU 2017. We need all speakers to register so as to
handle name badges, but far more importantly the accommodation needs and the associated "presenter deal".

Please can I get you to register as soon as possible via
https://www.cvent.com/events/accu-2017/registration-3de49a8356234224897b9dae119466da.aspx

Let myself or Charlotte Tanswell at Archer Yates Associates know if there are any problems with registering.

Russel.
