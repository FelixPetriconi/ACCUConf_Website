.. title: The Pac-Man Rule
////

Groups of people having conversions can often make closed circles which seems to exclude new
people joining the group. This was observed by Eric Holscher (@ericholscher on Twitter) at many
a conference so he proposed The Pac-Man Rule as a way of conversing groups making it obvious
that they were ready for new people to join in the conversation. He has written about the idea
https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/[here]. The "hidden agenda"
behind conference making this idea "a thing" is to try and make conversing groups open,
welcoming, and inclusive.

Dylan Beattie (@dylanbeattie on Twitter) has made a short (21s) animation to show the idea:
