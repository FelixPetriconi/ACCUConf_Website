*The ACCU conference call for session proposals is open. There is a separate Web application for entering
and amending proposals:* https://cfp.conference.accu.org

Historically, ACCU has a lot of {cpp} and C content, and is proud of that: ACCU is the foremost annual
conference for people interested in {cpp} and C, at least in and around the UK. But it is not just a {cpp}
and C conference, ACCU is about programming in whatever language people are using, with whatever tools and
processes people are using: D, Chapel, Java, Kotlin, C#, F#, Groovy, Rust, Go, Python, Ruby, Lisp, to name
just a few programming languages about which there have been sessions at ACCU conferences.  The ACCU
Conference is looking for sessions that will be interesting to people who create software.

The ACCU Conference is put on by ACCU (https://accu.org), but is open to anyone who wishes to be there
either as a presenter or just an attender.

ACCU is a membership organisation for people involved in software creation. The members are interested in
programming, programming languages, testing, the tools of developing software, the process of developing
software, and all related things. The tag line for the organisation is _Professionalism in Programming_.

The call for session proposals is now open. If you have an idea for a session do submit it at
https://cfp.conference.accu.org If you want to mull an idea over with someone before submitting, please
email the  mailto:conference@accu.org[conference chair].
