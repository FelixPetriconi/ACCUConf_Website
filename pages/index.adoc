*ACCU 2018 is now over and done. Thanks to everyone who submitted proposals. Apologies to those who could
 not be accepted. Special thanks to the presenters for all their efforts to put on great sessions. Massive
 thanks to all the attenders for making it a great conference.*

*Now on to ACCU 2019…*

Historically, ACCU has a lot of {cpp} and C content, and is proud of that: ACCU is the foremost annual
conference for people interested in {cpp} and C, at least in and around the UK. But it is not just a {cpp}
and C conference, ACCU is about programming in whatever language people are using, with whatever tools and
processes people are using: D, Chapel, Java, Kotlin, C#, F#, Groovy, Rust, Go, Python, Ruby, Lisp, to name
just a few programming languages about which there have been sessions at ACCU conferences.  The ACCU
Conference is looking for sessions that will be interesting to people who create software.

The ACCU conference has:

* 90 minute sessions, either:
** 60 minute presentation with 30 minutes questions and answersfootnote:[Some people choose to structure this
   as 90 minutes of interactive presentation instead of 60 minutes presentation and 30 minutes  Q&A, and
   that is fine – the point is to have interaction and dialogue. A 90 minutes one-way presentation without
   interaction is not really what we want.].
** a workshopfootnote:[A workshop is all about people doing things.].
* 180 minute workshopsfootnote:[For the situation when 90 minutes is just too short for the activity.].
* 20 minute sessions, 15 minute presentation and 5 minutes questions and answers.
* full day (6 hour with breaks) pre-conference workshops

There are also lightning talk sessions, but, as ever, these are organised at the conference.

The ACCU Conference is put on by ACCU (https://accu.org), but is open to anyone who wishes to be there
either as a presenter or just an attender.

ACCU is a membership organisation for people involved in software creation. The members are interested in
programming, programming languages, testing, the tools of developing software, the process of developing
software, and all related things. The tag line for the organisation is _Professionalism in Programming_.

The call for session proposals is now open. If you have an idea for a session do submit it at
