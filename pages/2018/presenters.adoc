Odin Holmes has been programming bare metal embedded systems for 15+ years and as any honest nerd admits most of that time was spent debugging his stupid mistakes. With the advent of the 100x speed up of template metaprogramming provided by {cpp}11 his current mission began: teach the compiler to find his stupid mistakes at compile time so he has more free time for even more template metaprogramming. Odin Holmes is the author of the kvasir::bit library, a DSL which wraps bare metal special function register interactions allowing full static checking and a considerable efficiency gain over the common practice. He is also active in building and refining the tools needed for this task such as the brigand MPL library, the kvasir::mpl. He is currently the embedded chair of the SG14 working group and co-organizer of the embo.io bare metal embedded conference.
