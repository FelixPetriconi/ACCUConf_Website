I was a professional software developer for 20 years before asking “Why did they do THAT!?” one time too many and going off to take a psychology degree to try to find out.

== Steven Simpson

Hardware verification engineer, turned software engineer, turned infrastructure engineer. Most recently involved with developing monitoring systems for supercomputers at a well known university, but with over ten years experience spanning a wide range of software engineering principles, problems and languages. This has ranged from developing firmware for high-performance network switches, building distributed SQL databases, and deploying HPC infrastructure.

Working as an ASIC verification engineer has led to an unhealthy paranoia when it comes testing software. Having lost many hours debugging deadlocks and memory corruptions, is most content when able to solve complex problems with the intelligible, uncomplicated code which is easily understood by others.

Previously a speaker at NDC Oslo, ACCU, CppCon, FOSDEM, PGDay conferences on various topics around databases and software development. Now moved to Oslo having lived in Bristol for thirteen years, primarily for the better weather.
