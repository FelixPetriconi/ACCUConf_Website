This page is dedicated to the sponsors and exhibitors of ACCU 2019. The presence of the exhibitors and the
contributions of the sponsors is a core component of the conference, and so we have here a permanent record
of their presence, logos of the moment, and links to the pages that were relevant at the time of the
conference. (As ever with the Web, links may eventually fail.)
