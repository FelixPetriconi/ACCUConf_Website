Kevlin is an independent consultant, trainer, reviewer and writer. His development interests are
in programming, people and practice. He has been a columnist for various magazines and web
sites, a contributor to open source software and a member of more committees than is probably
healthy (it has been said that "a committee is a cul-de-sac down which ideas are lured and then
quietly strangled"). He is co-author of two volumes in the *Pattern-Oriented Software
Architecture* series and editor of *97 Things Every Programmer Should Know* and the forthcoming
*97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know*.
