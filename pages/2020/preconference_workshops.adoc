[[ModernCppIdioms]]
== Modern {cpp} Idioms

=== Presenter

Mateusz Pusz

=== Bio

A software architect, chief engineer, and security champion with more than 15 years of
experience in designing, writing and maintaining {cpp} code for fun and living. {cpp}
consultant, trainer, conference speaker, and evangelist focused on Modern {cpp}. His main areas
of interest and expertise are code performance, low latency, stability, and security. Mateusz
worked at Intel for 13 years, and now he is the head of the {cpp} Competency Center at EPAM
Systems. He is also a founder of Train IT that provides dedicated {cpp} trainings and consultant
services to corporations. Mateusz is a contributor and an active voting member of the ISO {cpp}
Committee (WG21) where, together with the best {cpp} experts in the world, he shapes the future
of the {cpp} language. He is also a co-chair of WG21 Study Group 14 (SG14) responsible for
driving performance and low latency subjects in the Committee. In 2013 Mateusz won “Bench Games
2013” – worldwide competition in the {cpp} language knowledge.


=== Abstract

{cpp} is no longer C with classes and it never was only an Object Oriented language. {cpp} is a
general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming
features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. If used correctly,
it provides hard to beat performance. Such usage requires a good knowledge of {cpp} templates
and Modern {cpp} Idioms which are much different from commonly known design patterns popularized
by GoF book and invented to handle common use cases in pure OO languages like Java or C#.

=== What you will learn

During the workshop, we will refresh and broaden our knowledge about {cpp} templates and will
learn Modern {cpp} Idioms like Niebloid, EBO, CRTP, Type Erasure, and many more. Crafting those
skills will allow us to build powerful tools that are useful in the everyday work of every {cpp}
developer.

=== Experience required

In order to be able to follow the workshop, you should be current with {cpp} and have some
recent experience with writing simple {cpp} templates. {cpp}11/14 knowledge is suggested but not
mandatory.

=== Environment

A laptop with a relatively new {cpp} compiler. It is recommended to have the latest version of
one of the compilers (Visual Studio, gcc or clang).

[[ACCU101]]
== ACCU 101: Early Career Day

=== Presenters

Gail Ollis,
Kevlin Henney,
Giovanni Asproni,
Chris Oldwood,
Roger Orr

=== Bios

Gail has been presenting at conferences since 2007. Sharing knowledge also become part of the
day job, as a lecturer in programming and cyberpsychology at Bournemouth University. But that
was an accidental second career. Before that Gail was for two decades a commercial software
developer, eventually becoming so obsessed with the human aspects of the job that she took a
psychology degree to investigate further. In 2019 she completed her PhD in psychology of
software development and is working on applying her special interdisciplinary outlook to cyber
security. She loves to help people learn and develop. She hosted the first ever ACCU Early
Career Day last year and is looking forward to bringing together her Dream Team again to help
more early career developers in 2020.

Kevlin is an independent consultant, trainer, reviewer and writer. His development interests are
in programming, people and practice. He has been a columnist for various magazines and web
sites, a contributor to open source software and a member of more committees than is probably
healthy (it has been said that "a committee is a cul-de-sac down which ideas are lured and then
quietly strangled"). He is co-author of two volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software
Architecture series and editor of 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know and the forthcoming 97
Things Every Java Programmer Should Know.

Giovanni works as a Principal Consultant for Zühlke Engineering in London. He has been helping
software companies and teams become more successful for many years by providing consulting,
training and advice, as well as coding, to projects of all sizes. He is both a frequent
conference speaker, and organiser. He is a past Chair of the London XPDay and the ACCU
conferences, the Industry & Practice co-chair for XP2016, and the Conference Chair for SPA 2018
and SPA 2019. He is a member of the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, and contributed to the
book 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know, published by O'Reilly.

Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom coder in the 80’s writing assembler
on 8-bit micros. These days it's enterprise grade technology in plush corporate offices. He also
commentates on the Godmanchester duck race and can be easily distracted via gort@cix.co.uk or
@chrisoldwood.

Roger has many years of experience in IT, using a variety of languages and platforms, working
for a number of different companies over the years, mostly in the financial sector. His recent
work has mostly been in {cpp}, on both Windows and Linux. Roger is one of the organisers of this
conference and also runs the Code Critique column in ACCU's "CVu" magazine. He is chair of the
UK {cpp} panel, has represented the UK at {cpp} ISO standards meetings since 2010, and is a
member of the 'Direction Group', a five person group that recommends priorities for the ISO
{cpp} standardisation committee.

=== Abstract

This is an all-day pre-conference tutorial. But unlike other tutorials, the Early Career Day is
exclusively for software developers in their first years of work, whether as a placement student
or a graduate level employee. In the company of others with a similar level of experience, this
supportive tutorial will offer you clear and practical guidance in key aspects of your
work. Your tutors are well-known speakers selected for their excellent content and clear
delivery. If you are wondering if the ACCU conference is for you and how it can help you, this
is a great way to try out a 'mini-conference' designed especially for you by experts.

The day is chaired by Dr Gail Ollis, an ACCU conference regular who remembers what it was like
to attend her first ACCU conference. After a long career in commercial software development Gail
turned to teaching, as a lecturer in programming and cyberpsychology at Bournemouth
University. Think of this session as a short course in honing your craft as a software
developer, with an experienced lecturer as your course leader and the best presenters as your
tutor.

The content will include a mix of personal and technical skills, including:

* Presentation Skills
* Software Processes and Architecture
* Code review
* Debugging

The day will end with your very own lightning talk session, the ideal opportunity to practice
sharing your thoughts with a small, friendly audience.

[[GoodModernCppDesignAndPractices]]
== Good Modern {cpp} Design and Practices

=== Presenter

Peter Sommerlad

=== Bio

Peter Sommerlad is a consultant and trainer for Safe Modern {cpp} and Agile Software
Engineering. Peter was professor at and director of IFS Institute for Software at FHO/HSR
Rapperswil, Switzerland until February 2020. Peter is co-author of POSA Vol.1 and Security
Patterns. He inspired the {cpp} IDE Cevelop with a unique {cpp} feedback, refactoring, and code
modernization experience. Peter is a member of MISRA-{cpp}, Hillside, ACM, IEEE Computer
Society, ACCU, ISO WG23 and the ISO WG21 {cpp} committee.

=== Abstract

This workshop is trying to simplify your use of {cpp}. We have many great rule sets to chose
from, some partially outdated, like Scott Meyers 3rd edition, some futuristic, like the {cpp}
core guidelines. While working on the AUTOSAR {cpp} and new MISRA {cpp} guidelines I found that
many of the guidelines forbid things without giving actual guideline on how to do things and
when to deviate.

Also many talks on {cpp} explain the modern features and show how they work, but only few put
things into context and show what to give up and how things combine sanely. I am guilty of that
in the past as well, e.g., with my constexpr compile time computation talks at ACCU.

This full day workshop is the result of thinking about that. It won't show the newest {cpp}2a
feature by feature, but gives a coherent set of practices to improve your design and code using
existing standard {cpp} features where they give you benefits.

We will cover the following topics:

* designing function interfaces in a way that they are easy to call correctly and hard to call
  incorrectly
* how to report function contract violations (at least 5 different ones) and their individual
  benefits and liabilities, so you can make a conscious choice.
* what parameter passing style and return value style works best under what conditions
* how to create (parameter) type wrappers to avoid passing wrong arguments
* class design for simple value wrappers to improve function interfaces
* mix-in strategies for functionality and operators, so that creating value wrappers is simpler
* provide an overview of class styles, e.g., value, manager, oo-bases and show how to select
  from the rules for special member functions
* take a look at the lesser known {cpp}11 feature of ref-qualified member functions and show why
  and when to use them for your member functions

If you are brave enough, bring your own examples that we can look at and discuss where they are
perfect and where they could be improved. Otherwise, we will take a look at potential bugs in
the {cpp} standard library design.

[[IntroductionToCMake]]
== Introduction to CMake

=== Presenter

Craig Scott

=== Bio

Craig is a software consultant, CMake co-maintainer and author of the book “Professional CMake:
A Practical Guide”. He has been developing cross-platform {cpp} software since 2001, targeting
most major platforms and working on large scale frameworks, scientific algorithm development, Qt
GUI applications, backend services and embedded devices. He is the founder of Crascit Pty Ltd
and provides consulting services through that company.

=== Abstract

CMake is one of the most widely used build systems for C and {cpp} projects, but the initial
task of learning how to use it effectively can be overwhelming. The abundance of outdated
material online can make it hard to know if you are learning good practices or not. In this
hands-on workshop delivered by one of the CMake maintainers, you will learn how to follow best
practice to build and package an application. Emphasis will be on building the skills needed for
working with CMake projects in day-to-day development.

By the end of this workshop, participants should be able to do the following:

* Set up a basic CMake project from scratch.
* Define build targets for executables and libraries.
* Correctly express the way targets use or depend on each other.
* Express build requirements on targets and how they can propagate to other targets.
* Install targets and files following a standard layout.
* Produce packages in different formats.

=== Pre-requisites

A basic knowledge of C or {cpp}.

Attendees will be expected to bring a laptop with the latest CMake release installed. Please
ensure you have a compiler/toolchain installed according to the following requirements for your
laptop's platform:

* Windows: Visual Studio 2019 or later.
* MacOS: Xcode 10 or later, with command-line tools installed.
* Linux: The system default version of GCC should be sufficient on recent distributions.

blog: http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/

=== Abstract

There is lots of existing code in the world that lacks unit tests. In
this workshop you will learn techniques for quickly adding
regression tests, and in what situations you can use them.
Often you need to change code that lacks automated tests, and you need to do
that safely. In this workshop you will learn techniques for getting control of
that code and quickly adding regression tests. We will work with several
hands-on examples, and learn about in what situations you can use which
techniques.

Planned learning outcomes:

* Differences with Approval testing compared with ordinary unit testing
* how to use Code Coverage and Approval testing to make Characterization tests
* Risks and benefits of Approval testing

Suitable for: developers and testers who do automation. The examples and Approval testing tools
we will use are available in several programming languages including Java, C#, Python and {cpp},
although I will primarily demonstrate techniques using IntelliJ and Java.
