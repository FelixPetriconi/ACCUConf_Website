In previous years the ACCU Conference website was just a part of the ACCU website using the same content
management system. This year we are branching out and creating a website for the conference that is separate
from the main ACCU website. As many of you will know the ACCU website has moved and completed changed
infrastructure, it is this revolution that has enabled separation of the technologies for the main website
and the conference website.

The conference website will principally be a Flask/Python3/SQLAlchemy/SQLite3 system but with the blog and
static pages being Nikola managed. Clearly this is an experiment. But we are going with "release early,
release often" so we are putting the Nikola blog and static pages up now so as to get assistance designing
and styling the pages and preparing the ground for the dynamic section which will handle session proposal
submission, proposal review, accepted session scheduling and rendering of the programme, speakers, and
session blurbs.

This website is almost certainly going to change style and structure as well as content on a fairly regular basis.

If anyone wants to get involved in helping bring this infrastructure to fruition in the few weeks we have,
all help gratefully accepted, email conference@accu.org.
