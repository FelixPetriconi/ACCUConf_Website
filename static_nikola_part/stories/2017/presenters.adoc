== Burkhard Kloss

link:sessions.html#XTheEthicsofSoftwaresomepracticalconsiderations[The Ethics of Software - some practical considerations]

I only came to England to walk the Pennine Way… 25 years later I still haven’t done it.

Sometimes hands on, sometimes managing people. Somewhere along the way I realised you can do cool stuff quickly in Python, and I’ve never lost my fascination with making machines smarter.

debugging his stupid mistakes. With the advent of the 100x speed up of 
template metaprogramming provided by {cpp}11 his current mission began: 
teach the compiler to find his stupid mistakes at compile time so he has 
more free time for even more template metaprogramming. Odin Holmes is 
the author of the Kvasir.io library, a DSL which wraps bare metal 
special function register interactions allowing full static checking and 
a considerable efficiency gain over common practice. Along the way he 
has discovered many patterns and improvements in expression templates,

Software engineer with 10 years experience spanning a wide range of problems and languages, with an overall focus on systems level code in C/{cpp}. This has ranged from embedded C firmware development for high-performance network switches, to the implementation of a distributed analytical SQL database. Additionally, a stint as an ASIC verification engineer has led to an unhealthy paranoia when it comes testing software. Having lost many hours debugging deadlocks and memory corruptions, is most content when able to solve complex problems with the intelligible, uncomplicated code which is easily understood by others.

Proud of having only ever worked for start-up companies, was mad enough to work for a third, currently developing data centre monitoring and distributed application profiling solutions for OpenStack based HPC environments. Regular attendee of the ACCU Bristol meet-up group. Dislikes include scope creep, buzzwords and marzipan.
