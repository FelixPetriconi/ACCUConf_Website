.. title: Code of Conduct
.. type: text
////

We value the participation of each member of the software development community and want all attenders to
have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all people at the conference are expected to show
respect and courtesy to all other people at the conference throughout the conference, and at all conference
events, whether officially sponsored by ACCU or not.

To make clear what is expected, all attenders, speakers, exhibitors, organisers, and volunteers at any ACCU
conference are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will ensure that it is
enforced throughout the event.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

== The Short Version

ACCU is dedicated to providing an harassment-free conference experience for everyone.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different
backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any of the conference
sessions or activities.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attenders. Behave professionally. Remember that any
discriminatory (as in sexist, racist, etc.) or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for ACCU.

Attenders violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion
of the conference organisers.

== The Long Version

Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces;
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of
talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors and sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not
use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Exhibitor staff (including volunteers) should not use
sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be
offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the conference organisers may take
any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
refund.

== Reporting Harassment

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you
should contact one of the organising staff or a member of the conference committee. Please see these
link:coc_reporting_harassment.html[reporting guidelines].

Contact details will be made available shortly before the conference.

Reports of harassment will be dealt with according to link:coc_handling_reports.html[these guidelines].
