=== Abstract

=== Bio


Bradford Chamberlain is a Principal Engineer at Cray Inc. where he works on parallel programming models. He
serves as the technical lead for the Chapel project which is developing a portable, open-source language for
parallel programming on large-scale systems. In this role, Brad focuses primarily on leading the design and
implementation of the Chapel language with his team at Cray and members of the open-source development
community. Brad received his Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Washington in
2001 working on the ZPL parallel array language. In the past, he has also worked on languages for embedded
reconfigurable processors and on algorithms for accelerating the rendering of complex 3D scenes.

=== _AI: Actual Intelligence_

=== Abstract

It has been said, to err is human, to really foul things up requires a computer [citation needed]. Given the
long tradition of AI, which sometimes attempts to make a sentient being from hardware, or body parts (think
Frankenstein’s monster), are humans unique, or is this dream possible? Or desirable?

Intelligence is also used to mean information the state or businesses gather on you; this is increasingly
done by machine. We frequently have to prove who we are by stating Mother’s maiden names, passwords, even
swiping fingerprints. Much of this is processed by machine, powered by algorithms.  What if they don’t
believe we are who we say we are?

There is more to intelligence than an algorithm. Your thoughts have a context; belief systems, experience,
insight, thinking, learning. SciFi offers Asimov's law of robots. Clearly first order logic isn't enough.
Obviously brute force isn’t intelligence. So what is? Do we need it to run on hardware? Conversely, could we
exist in cyberspace without a body? Where will it end?

Frances Buontempo is currently editor of the ACCU’s Overload magazine and is working as a researcher at
City, University of London, working on a project to provide diversity enhancements to SIEMS (Security
Information and Event Management)

After graduating from Leeds University with a B.A. in Mathematics and Philosophy, she worked as a
mathematics and IT secondary school teacher, eventually ending up as a programmer. During this time she
obtained an M.Sc. in Pure Mathematics with the Open University, and then returned to Leeds University, to
study for a PhD in data mining to predict how toxic organic chemicals might be. Between then and now, she
has worked in various companies in London with a finance focus.

She has talked and written about various ways to program your way out of a paper bag, providing a gentle
introduction to some machine learning approaches, while trying to keep up to date with new techniques.


== Herb Sutter

=== _Something(s) New in C++_

=== Abstract

By the time the ACCU 2017 conference begins, {cpp}17 is expected to be technically complete and in its final
approval ballot. What comes next? Will {cpp} continue growing forever? Can {cpp} code be simplified? This is a
brand-new talk of material I've never given before, in which I'll present one (or more) of three proposals
I'm personally working on to further improve {cpp} post-{cpp}17. All follow a common theme – adding a strategic
language and/or library feature to {cpp} that leads to significant, and sometimes dramatic, simplification of
real-world {cpp} code. I'll pick which one (or more) of those topics to present sometime in March – watch for
this title and abstract to be replaced with more specific information at least one month before the ACCU
2017 conference begins.
