The splendid people at http://www.archer-yates.co.uk[Archer-Yates], who partner http://www.accu.org[ACCU] in
putting on ACCUConf, and who handle all the organising and finances, have a little micro-website for
handling registration for the conference. It makes legal and financial, as well as organisational, sense to
have the registration site separate from this one, even though, at first sight, it may seem awkward. The
really important thing though is that they have "opened for business": registration for ACCU 2017 is now
open!

So take a leap via the big orange button saying http://www.cvent.com/d/dvqxq2[REGISTER FOR ACCU 2017 HERE],
sign in, register, secure your place now.
