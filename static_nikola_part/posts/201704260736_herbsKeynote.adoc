The original title and blurb for Herb's keynote closing ACCU 2017 left room for one of many actual
presentations. Herb has now sent in the choice he has made. So the printed materials now have the
wrong title and blurb. The selected title is:

link:/stories/2017/sessions.html#XThoughtsonMetaclasses[Thoughts on Metaclasses]

which is a link through to the blurb on the website. The website and the Web application have the correct
title and blurb even if the printed materials have been overtaken by events.
