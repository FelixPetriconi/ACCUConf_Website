After some stress and a lot of work, we think we may, just may, have sorted the major problems with the
session proposal submission system. This is not to say the system is pretty, but it should be
functional: people should be able to register, then login, then submit, and even amend their proposals.

I am hoping that next year, this will all be a lot smoother. And prettier.

If there are any further problems please feel free to submit an issue
https://github.com/ACCUConf/ACCUConf_Website/issues[here] and/or email mailto:conference@accu.org[the
conference chair].
