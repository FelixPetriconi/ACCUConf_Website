= How to start

Setting up an ACCU conference website development environment

Original by Felix Petriconi, amendments by Russel Winder


== Introduction

These instructions assume that you have an Debian Sid or Ubuntu 16.04 (or later) installation with Python 3
and Git available and your Git environment configured.  Other platforms may be used, obviously, but have not
been tested.

== Forking and cloning the Git repository

To set up your working clone:

* Fork the https://github.com/ACCUConf/ACCUConf_Website.git repository on GitHub to your own account.
* On your computer cd to a directory that will be the parent of the working directory.
* Clone your GitHub fork to your working directory:
** `git clone git@github.com:<Your Account>/ACCUConf_Website.git ACCUConf_Website`
* cd to the working directory ACCUConf_Website.
* Add the mainline repository as a tracking branch:
** `git remote add mainline https://github.com/ACCUConf/ACCUConf_Website.git`

This should give you a fully working set up.

The basic workflow is to make changes in your local clone, push them to your fork on GitHub, and then make
pull requests to the mainline. It is important though always to work against the up to date mainline so
whenever you want to make any changes, first make sure your fork and local clone are up to date with the
mainline:

* Fetch the latest changes from the mainline: `git fetch mainline`
* Update the local repo with the mainline changes: `git merge mainline/master`
* Update your fork on GitHub: `git push`

== A crucial local amendment

Because of the way the build works, it is important to add a symbolic links from specific places in the
directory hierarchy to other specific places in the hierarchy. So from the working directory you should:

* `cd flask_application_part/accuconf`
* `ln -s ../../static_nikola_part/output static`
* `cd ../../`

* `cd flask_application_part/accuconf/proposals/templates`
* `ln -s ../../../../static_nicola_part/themes/accuconf/templates/accuconf.tmpl accuconf.html`
* `cd ../../../../`

This is a "do once for each new clone". The link is not present in the repository since it is not needed for
the deployed website, it is only needed for running the test server in your local clone.


== Getting the toolchain

So as to build the website you will need Python 3, the Nikola framework, the Flask framework, SQLAlchemy,
SQLite, and the Asciidoctor system. To run the Flask-based subsystem tests you will need PyTest and
Hypothesis.

Although it is generally good to use packages whenever possible, there are some aspects of the required
setup that mean we must use pip and packages from PyPI. Always avoid using pip as superuser to put packages
from PyPI into the platform package managed area. Always use pip into your personal area, i.e. when using pip always
use the --user option.

The Debian and Ubuntu packages for Nikola are Python 2 based, so Nikola is installed
using pip. There are some Flask related packages but there are some (important for our situation here)
missing packages. The Debian and Ubuntu package for everything else are up to date and so can be used.

* Ensure the following packages are installed (other packages will be installed as dependencies):
** python3
** python3-pip
** python3-hypothesis
** python3-pep8
** python3-pytest
** asciidoctor
* From within the working directory:
** Install Nikola: `pip3 install --user -r static_nikola_part/requirements.txt`
** Install Flask: `pip3 install --user -r flask_application_part/pip_requirements.txt`

If you find that the asciidoctor package is not working or is not available then you can:

* Install Ruby: `sudo aptitude install ruby`
* Install Asciidoctor: `sudo gem install asciidoctor`
* You may also want to install the PDF generator:  `sudo gem install asciidoctor-pdf`

== Building the website

It is always important to have the static material up to date and built. The reason for this is that the
Flask application assumes it can access the static material – hence the symbolic link we put in place during
creation of the working directory. In particular all the styling data for the Flask application is stored in
the static material – long story but it is the right set up for this website.

Build the static part:

* `cd static_nikola_part/`
* `nikola build`
* `cd ..`

== Running the application

The Flask application assumes the presence of a SQLite database file. Running the tests uses the same file
as when you run the application for interactive sessions, so if you want the preserve data from an
interactive session make sure you backup the flask_application_part/accuconf.db and
flask_application_part/accuconf_test.db files for putting back in place later.

To create an initial database:

* `cd flask_application_part/`
* `./create_db.py`
* `cd ..`

To run all the tests:

* `py.test-3 pytest flask_application_part`

or if that fails for some reason:

* `python3 -m pytest flask_application_part`

To run the Flask application for interactive use (but remember the point about there must be a database and
the tests are destructive of the database):

* `./runapp.py`

You should now be able to navigate to http://localhost:8000 with any reasonable browser and use the website
from your working directory.
